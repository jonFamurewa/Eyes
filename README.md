# Following Eye
Eyes project - In this project we made eyes that track the cursor as you move it around on the screen. To use this page all that you have to do is move your cursor around the page.
Next in this repository I would like to add a proper navigation bar that is consistent on all of the pages.This would help with navigation on the site and continutiy in the user experience.
